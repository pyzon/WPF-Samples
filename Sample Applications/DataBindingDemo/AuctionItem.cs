            // symbols here. It also would consider whether the simple concatenation
            // of the text would provide the expected experience in all regions.

            // Important: The text contained inside the item is exposed through the
            // Control view of the UI Automation (UIA) API. This indicates to a 
            // screen reader that the UI is of interest to customers. However, by 
            // default the star UI is not exposed in this way. Given that the

            // of the item. If that information was not being included here, action
